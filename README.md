# Welcome to the Browser Extension Explorer!

This extension is a collection of open source examples demonstrating how
the various parts of browser extensions work.

In order to make the source code easy to understand, it intentionally
uses **zero** automated build tools. This means you can
clone this project and immediately load the extension into your browser
as-is.
